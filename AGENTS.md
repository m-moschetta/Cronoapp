# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `app/` holds Expo Router screens and layouts. Routes live under `app/(tabs)/` for tabbed views, with shared navigation in `app/_layout.tsx`.
- `src/lib/` contains app services and integrations (e.g., Firebase, API helpers, i18n).
- `src/theme/` contains design tokens and styling helpers.
- `src/types/` contains shared TypeScript types.
- `assets/` stores images and static assets used by the app.
- `ios/` is the native iOS project generated by Expo.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run start` starts the Expo dev server (default local workflow).
- `npm run android` builds/runs the Android app via Expo.
- `npm run ios` builds/runs the iOS app via Expo.
- `npm run web` starts the web build via Expo.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript and React Native with Expo Router.
- Indentation: 4 spaces in TS/TSX (follow existing files).
- Components: PascalCase; hooks/use-state variables: camelCase.
- Keep imports grouped by origin (external, internal, local) and avoid unused imports.
- No formatter or linter is configured; keep changes minimal and consistent with surrounding code.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated tests are currently configured in this repository.
- If you add tests, document the framework in `package.json`, add scripts like `npm run test`, and note the expected scope (unit, integration, or e2e).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Git history is minimal (only "Initial commit"), so no enforced commit format exists.
- Preferred: short, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Fix report range selection").
- PRs should describe the behavior change, list manual test steps, and include screenshots for UI changes.
- If a change alters navigation or onboarding, call that out explicitly in the PR description.

## Configuration Notes
- Firebase and API setup live under `src/lib/`. Keep secrets out of the repo and use environment configuration appropriate for Expo.
- When updating Firebase schemas or API shapes, update `src/types/` and align with any cached query keys.
